Prescreen questions:
Question 1:

 

# Use any Object-Oriented language to complete this task.

#

# Create a class named LuckyNumber.

#

# The constructor for LuckyNumber should take a single argument: a string called first_name (e.g.: "Marc").

#

# In the LuckyNumber class create two methods, generate_data and display_data, that take no arguments.

#

# The generate_data method should create and return a new object everytime it is called. (e.g. Python dictionary, Java Map)

# The object returned by generate_data method should contain 2 things:

# 1) A field named "date" with the current date in string format.

# 2) A field named "lucky_number" with a random floating point number between 0-100 in string format (2 decimal places).

# e.g. { "date": "23 Nov 2021", "lucky_number": "55.67" }

# 

# The display_data method should do two things:

# 1) Call the generate_data method to retrieve a new date and lucky_number.

# 2) Print a message addressed to first_name, along with the date and lucky number.

# e.g.: "Hello Marc, your lucky number for 23 Nov 2021 is: 55.67"

#

# Finally, create an object of type LuckyNumber and call the display_data method.

Question 2:

# The any language of your choice:

#

# Write a function, get_matches, that takes two arguments, pattern (a string), and words (a list of strings).

#

# e.g.: pattern = "aabba", words = ["a", "wwffw", "xxccx", "xxhhi", "aaaaa", "aaaa", "wwccw", "qqffqq"]

#

# Matching words will have a one-to-one mapping between characters in the pattern and characters the word.

#

# The function should return a list containing words matching the pattern.

#

# In the example above, the function would return ["wwffw", "xxccx", "wwccw"]

Question 3:

How does the Docker daemon isolate processes in and limit resources to containers?

Question 4:
